# v4.0 Unified Routing

`/ui` is the UI-led entry into a normal Work Item. The existing UI methodology remains authoritative for the UI Design Track, but the work must still participate in UNDERSTAND → DISCOVER → DESIGN → PLAN → IMPLEMENT → SELF_VERIFY → REVIEW → ACCEPT. UI changes must not ignore backend/API/data implications, and backend changes must not ignore required UI semantics.

# /ui

Design or refactor UI using project-aware design reasoning before producing a prototype.

## 0. Determine UI Intent

Classify:
- REFINE
- REFACTOR
- REDESIGN

If the user explicitly requests a refactor/redesign, do not downgrade to a minor refinement merely to maximize component reuse.

## 1. Project Context Audit

Inspect relevant repository reality:
- language/framework/platform
- UI/component library
- styling/theme/token system
- production font stack
- icon system
- layout/responsive conventions
- existing shared components
- target routes/screens and business capability

Create/update `UI_DESIGN_STRATEGY.md` or equivalent for STANDARD+ structural UI work.

## 2. Product + User Goal

Identify:
- product type
- primary user goal
- primary information
- primary action
- secondary/support information

## 3. Legacy UI Decomposition

For REFACTOR/REDESIGN, inspect existing UI to extract capabilities, not to preserve appearance.

Classify old regions/components:
PRESERVE / MODIFY / MOVE / REPLACE / REMOVE

## 4. Design Methodology Pass

Before visual styling, establish:
- information hierarchy
- information architecture
- action hierarchy
- density mode
- visual hierarchy
- spacing system
- typography hierarchy
- progressive disclosure
- state coverage
- responsive behavior

Follow `.ai/rules/UI_DESIGN_METHODOLOGY.md`.

## 5. Component Capability Audit

Map intended elements to the real project:
REUSE / RESTYLE / EXTEND / CREATE / REPLACE

Identify fidelity risks caused by current component APIs or platform limitations.

## 6. HTML Prototype Requirement

For every UI-impacting request set:

- `PROTOTYPE_REQUIREMENT=REQUIRED`
- `PROTOTYPE_MODE=HTML`

This includes REFINE/MINOR changes. Keep small changes proportional, but do not skip HTML review or explicit approval. Native/component-compatible previews may support feasibility work but do not satisfy the gate.

## 7. Prototype-to-Production Technical Plan

Before or alongside the prototype, document:
- target stack
- component mapping
- component changes/new components
- styling/token strategy
- font/icon strategy
- responsive implementation
- interaction/API dependencies
- technical risks and mitigation

The HTML prototype must not invent controls that production contracts cannot support without recording required cross-layer changes.

Create `PROTOTYPE_INTERACTION_CONTRACT.md` and enumerate every material datum/action. Classify each as AVAILABLE / DERIVABLE / API_EXTENSION / NEW_API / NOT_SUPPORTED. API_EXTENSION/NEW_API requires an assigned Backend Capability Request; NOT_SUPPORTED requires revising and re-approving the prototype before production work.

## 8. Prototype

Create an actual isolated, renderable `.html/.htm` prototype using realistic content and state density. A Markdown strategy/plan or native-framework preview is not the required review prototype. Capture at least one visual reference/screenshot.

For multi-surface structural work, maintain a Prototype Coverage Matrix for primary pages, secondary/tertiary pages, dialogs and materially changed states.

For REFACTOR/REDESIGN, do not merely copy the old DOM/component structure and reskin it.

## 9. Design Critique

Before asking for approval, independently critique:
- task clarity
- hierarchy
- grouping
- density
- spacing
- typography
- action competition
- container overuse
- state coverage
- implementation feasibility
- refactor independence where relevant

Revise material failures first.

## 10. Approval

User review is mandatory for every UI change. Distinguish `DESIGN_DIRECTION_APPROVED` from `PROTOTYPE_APPROVED`; only explicit user confirmation recorded as `Approval Status: APPROVED` authorizes production translation. Silence, inferred approval and `WAIVED_BY_USER` do not pass.

After prototype approval, use `/ui-lock` before production implementation. All production UI edits remain blocked until the lock exists.

## 11. Production

Use `/ui-implement` to translate the approved design into the target framework without silently redesigning it.

Do not implement missing backend behavior with static data, local-only state, empty handlers, hardcoded success, mock responses or disabled controls presented as complete functionality.

## 12. Verification

Use `/ui-verify` after implementation. Verify content, elements, structure, geometry, style, responsive behavior, interaction, and accepted technical deviations.

Verification must produce a backend coordination report. Any OPEN backend item is shown to the user and keeps the UI BLOCKED/PARTIAL.
